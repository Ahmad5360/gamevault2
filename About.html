                    <p>
                      I was summoned into this pitiful mortal realm in 1991 and
                      raised by marauding wolves. Like most younglings I had grand
                      ambitions toward world domination, but as I matured and came
                      to understand more about this odd realm I realised that ruling
                      it would likely be tedious and involve far too much paperwork.
                      And so I tempered by dreams to just playing a lot of games and
                      trying not to punch every human I came across. Thus far I
                      achieved one of those dreams.
                      <br />
                      Something clearly went wrong with my summoning because I came
                      into this world with Cystic Fibrosis. It’s a bit of a pain in
                      the arse. Due to this my furry parents made the choice to
                      home-school me themselves because schools are filled with
                      viruses, and I’m a tad more vulnerable to them. Every time I
                      get one I add a bit more scarring to my lungs, although I hear
                      chicks dig scars, so maybe that’s a good thing. Plus, at the
                      tender age of 5 I was still attempting to eat most humans I
                      came across and my parents made the choice to home-school me
                      themselves because schools are filled with viruses, and I’m a
                      tad more vulnerable to them. Every time I get one I add a bit
                      more scarring to my lungs, although I hear chicks dig scars,
                      so maybe that’s a good thing. Plus, at the tender age of 5 I
                      was still attempting to eat most humans I came across and my
                      parents didn’t fancy dealing with all that faff.
                      <br />
                      Somewhere along the line my wolf parents acquired electricity
                      and a TV, and thus my first gaming memories are of a Sega
                      Genesis. What a beautiful console it was, and I spent hours
                      and hours playing the likes of Sonic the Hedgehog, Alex the
                      Kidd and Streets of Rage.

                        src="./images/about.jpg"
                        width="930"
                        style="max-width: 100%; margin: 20px 0"
                        alt="about-img 1"
                        class="img-fluid"
                      />
                      My four-legged father was big on technology, and so we had
                      computers fairly early on. It was on that and through my sire
                      that I learned of new games like Duke Nukem, Max Payne and
                      Total Annihilation. We used to attend to 24-hour parties where
                      I was inevitably found playing Jazz Jackrabbit on our friend’s
                      PC rather than talking to pesky human fools.
                      <br />
                      Next up was an original Playstation where I spent my time
                      playing Mortal Kombat, racing against my older brother in
                      Colin McRae Rally and running around in Grand Theft Auto 3.
                      For a long while I didn’t have a memory card, so I replayed
                      the opening hours of games over and over and over again. I
                      fell in love with the likes of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,
                      Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, Matt Hoffman’s Pro BMX, Command &
                      Conquer and playing around in Music 2000.
                      <br />
                      Then came my Playstation 2, a whole new generation of games to
                      play. I remember it less, though. My truly formative time came
                      with the Xbox 360 of which I have the strongest memories. I
                      think this was the generation that truly cemented by love of
                      games. The first game I played on it was Gears of War,
                      followed by The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, a game in which I’ve
                      spent hundreds of hours over the years.
                      <br />
                      There was no eureka moment when I started writing about games.
                      It just seemed like a fun thing to do one day, and I never got
                      around to stopping. Here we are years later, and by complete
                      accident and a series of unfortunate events I’ve wound up
                      running a website all about reviewing games. For reasons
                      unknown to me, you human weirdos seem to like reading some of
                      my ramblings, and so I keep doing it. Maybe one day I’ll stop
                      and get a life. I’ve heard they are quite good.
                      <br />
                      And so the poorly named http://www.wolfsgamingblog.com was
                      born. I regret the choice of name, but at the time it was more
                      of a blog. Now that I’m fortunate enough to deal with
                      companies and get review code and hardware, the name is a bit
                      problematic because many places instantly write me off to to
                      the “blog” part. I still can’t get an article posted on N4G
                      without it being instantly reported.
                      <br />
                      My aim is to deliver the most honest reviews I can. I don’t
                      run this site for profit except for the occasion guest post
                      which I always clearly label. I try my best to deliver honest
                      opinions on whatever I play. Sometimes, those opinions agree
                      with everyone else, sometimes they don’t. Quite often they
                      deviate from the mainstream sites say.
